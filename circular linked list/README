In a circular Singly linked list, the last node of the list contains a pointer to the first node of the list. We can have circular singly linked list as well as circular doubly linked list.
We traverse a circular singly linked list until we reach the same node where we started. 
Insertion at beginning
Adding a node into circular singly linked list at the beginning.
Insertion at the end
Adding a node into circular singly linked list at the end.
1	Deletion at beginning
Removing the node from circular singly linked list at the beginning.
2	Deletion at the end
Removing the node from circular singly linked list at the end.
3	Searching
Compare each element of the node with the given item and return the location at which the item is present in the list otherwise return null.
4	Traversing
